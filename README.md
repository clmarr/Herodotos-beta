# Herodotos-beta
A branch off of the Herodotos Project NER Annotation and Tagger project. 
Exploratory work with NER tagging of other texts for downstream purposes.

This repository includes texts annotated for named entities as part of the [Herodotos Project](https://u.osu.edu/herodotos/) (Ohio State University / Ghent University) and will use a BiLSTM-CRF tagger based on that of ([Lample et al., 2016](https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.01360)) pre-trained on said annotation. 
Please check out the [Humanities Entity Recognizer](https://github.com/alexerdmann/HER) for more details on how it was trained in the prior project.

**All texts are in Latin** taken from the [Latin Library Collection](https://www.thelatinlibrary.com) (collected by [CLTK](https://github.com/cltk/latin_text_latin_library)) or the [Perseus Latin Collection](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/collection?collection=Perseus:collection:Greco-Roman).
**Greek may be added soon** 

This project will involve a focus on the ancient ethnography of the Western Roman Empire and adjacent regions, especially, Gaul, Germania, and northwestern Africa. 
While the original Herodotos project (described in Erdmann et al. (2016), "[Challenges and Solutions for Latin Named Entity Recognition](http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W16-4012)) focused on the Classical Latin of the Late republic and early Principate period, this project will also incorporate works from Late Antiquity.

**more details to come.**
